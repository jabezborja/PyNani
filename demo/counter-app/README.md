# A PyFyre App
Get started by modifying the [src/index.py](src/index.py).

Learn PyFyre by reading the [documentation](https://pyfyre.netlify.app/). It is also advisable to learn [Brython](https://www.brython.info/) alongside PyFyre as it is built on top of Brython.

### Scripts
```
python run.py
  Run your PyFyre project in development mode.

python build.py
  Build your PyFyre project for production deployment.
```

### Deployment
All the files required to run your website are stored in the [public](public) directory so you can just serve or deploy the [public](public) directory to the web.
